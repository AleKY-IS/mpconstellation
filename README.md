# MPConstellation

MPConstellation is a group project for ME 231A at UC Berkeley. The goal of the project is to demonstrate model-predictive control (MPC) for a constellation of satellites.

## Tests

To run a specific test method, use for example:

`python3 -m unittest test_simulator.TestSimulator.test_get_trajectory_ODE`


For a whole test suite:

`python3 test_satellite.py`


For all test suites (current working directory must be the repo directory):

`python3 -m unittest`
